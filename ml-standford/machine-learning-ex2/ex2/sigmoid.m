function g = sigmoid(z)
%SIGMOID Compute sigmoid function
%   g = SIGMOID(z) computes the sigmoid of z.

% You need to return the following variables correctly
g = zeros(size(z));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Compute the sigmoid of each value of z (z can be a matrix,
%               vector or scalar).

g = 1 ./ (1 + exp(-z));


% initially i thought this was a built in function in octave
% this is actually a function that returns the value of the sigmoid of z 
% =============================================================
